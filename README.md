# Bookbot
Boot.dev Bookbot project

BookBot is my first project! (Not really but I was forced to write that line)

This small single-file program takes in the text of the book Frankenstein, parses it to count the words and number of instances of each letter, and then prints a report on that information.

methods utilized:
* with open(path) as f:
* .isalpha()
* .split()
* .lower()
* len()
* lists & dictionaries
* printf
* sorting via list.sort(reverse: bool, key: (any))
